		<h2>Travel To Your Dream Destination</h2>
		<p>When you are involved in a long drive and your ass starts to get sore or numb. Travel Ass is not limited to just car trips, but the terminology changes to match whatever activity is involved with long amounts of sitting and going numb. When you play video games for too long, it becomes Gamer's Ass. When you work an office job, it becomes Office Ass, etc.</p>

		<h2>Hands Up ! Party </h2>
		<p>An extended Mauritian Party where several families will travel to a random vacation spot together. Each parent is armed with his/her own Nikon for extreme photo-taking, and will insist on taking group photos far too often, obstructing the paths of nearby non-tourists. Popular destinations are Port-Louis, Albion , Grand-Baie ,... but be prepared to run into a Vacasian group wherever you may be. Group size can range anywhere from 2 to 60+ families. Common Asian Party activities may still occur, such as roti-eating and walking by Savatte Dodo.</p>
